# Ford-GoBike-Data-Analysis

As part of a Data Findings Project, I used the Ford GoBike 2017 dataset, which is provided online (https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data).

The main objective of my analysis is to look at the behavior difference between customers and subscribers of the bike sharing system and use that to explain their behavioral patterns. 

I started off my exploratory analysis by looking at the behavior of all users. This included trip duration, distance travelled and weekday patterns. I then continued by looking at the different riding frequency of each user type (customer vs subscriber). I dug a little deeper to get more information on the demographics of subscribers. Afterwards, I compared the behavioral patterns between the two users.

Main finding from my exploratory analysis is that the most frequent users of Ford GoBike are in fact subscribers, which constitutes mostly of males, users of ages 28-38 that travel on average a distance of 2 km. Their behavior patterns communicate that they very often commute via GoBike from Monday to Friday, with peak hours right before and after working hours, which shown using a heatmap. On the other hand, customers are more likely to take rides of longer duration, during the weekends, which I presume was for leisure purposes.
